# CodeAlpha - Stock Portfolio Tracker

## ✅ Project Title:
**Stock Portfolio Tracker (Manual Input Version)**

## 📌 Task Description:
This is a simple Python-based stock tracker that allows users to enter stock names and quantities. It calculates the total investment value based on hardcoded stock prices and optionally saves the results in a `.txt` file.

This task was completed as part of the Python Programming Internship at **CodeAlpha**.

## 💡 Features:
- Takes user input for stock names and quantity.
- Uses a predefined dictionary for stock prices.
- Calculates individual and total investment value.
- Saves the summary to a `.txt` file (`portfolio_summary.txt`).

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used:
- Dictionaries in Python
- Input/Output handling
- File writing (`.txt`)
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Control flow (`if-else`, `while` loops)
